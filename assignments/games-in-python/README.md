## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Create a Python program that lets a player guess letters to uncover a secret word. The game should track the number of incorrect guesses and end when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list
- Accept single-letter guesses from the user
- Display the current progress (e.g., _ a _ _ m a n)
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining
- End the game with a win message if the word is guessed
- End the game with a lose message if attempts are exhausted

Example:
```text
Word: _ _ _ _ _ _ _
Guess a letter: a
Word: _ a _ _ _ a _
Incorrect guesses left: 5
...etc...
```
